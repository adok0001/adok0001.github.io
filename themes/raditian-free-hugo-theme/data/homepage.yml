  title: "Who am I?"
  content: '<p class="lead">
   As a recent graduate in Computer Science with experience in software development, I have a strong foundation in programming languages such as Java, Python, and C#, and frameworks such as React Native and Node.js. 
   In my software development experience, I have contributed to the development of a customer-facing application and gained experience in agile methodologies. In my current role as a computer programming instructor, 
   I have successfully taught classes on game development, web programming, and python, and have contributed to a high student retention rate. In my technical projects, 
   I have demonstrated leadership skills in organizing and leading a team, and have applied my knowledge of cloud services, such as AWS and Azure, to implement microservice architectures and streamline deployment processes.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    My area of focus lies in designing web and mobile products, user research as well as
    leading of design & front-end teams. I enjoy designing and coding the UI as much as
    talking with users to iterate and improve the experiences that reach business goals.
