# Tamara's Portfolio Website
######

This is my portfolio website, built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and flexible static site generator. It showcases my projects, skills and experience.

## Getting Started

To run the website locally, you will need to have [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) installed on your machine.

1. Clone the repository:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/adok0001/adok0001.github.io.git
```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

```powershell
cd my-website
```
3. Run the development server:

```powershell
hugo server
```
4. Open the website in your browser at http://localhost:1313

## Building the website

To build the website for production, run the following command:

```powershell
hugo
```
This will generate the static files in the `public` directory.

## Customizing the theme

The website uses the [raditian-free-hugo-theme](https://raditian-hugo.radity.com) theme. To customize the theme, you can edit the files in the `themes/raditian-free-hugo-theme` directory.

## Deployment

The website is hosted on GitHub Pages. To deploy the website, push the changes to the gh-pages branch and configure GitHub Pages to use that branch as the source.
